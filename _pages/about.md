<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi, I am Zoey Lyu, an undergraduate computer science student at UNC-Chapel Hill, interested in using AI for building a better society. 

My research interest includes multi-modal models in Machine Learning, AI4Science (healthcare in neurosience and computational cognitive neuroscience), and Computer Vision. I am designing deep learning model to predict likelihood of getting human degenerative disease based on risk factors, supervised by  <a href='https://tianlong-chen.github.io/'>Professor Tianlong Chen. 

My undergraduate study is cross-disciplinary thanks to the general education requirements of UNC, leading me to reveal my interests for serving a greater community with knowledge and tech. I started off as a business major student admitted to Kenan-Flagler business school of UNC-Chapel Hill with a Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) minor. Spending 2 gap semesters back home interning for investment bank and volunteering for my neighbourhood during pandemic, I realized the importance of maintaining equality and what technology can bring to revolutionize the current barriers in today's world. From exchanging at Peking University, I found my passion in using Artificial Intelligence and thereby joined UNC's computer science program to pursue my interests in AI4Neuroscience and AI trustworthiness.
